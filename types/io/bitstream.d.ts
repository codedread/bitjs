/**
 * This object allows you to peek and consume bits and bytes out of a stream.
 * Note that this stream is optimized, and thus, will *NOT* throw an error if
 * the end of the stream is reached.  Only use this in scenarios where you
 * already have all the bits you need.
 *
 * Bit reading always proceeds from the first byte in the buffer, to the
 * second byte, and so on. The MTL flag controls which bit is considered
 * first *inside* the byte.
 *
 * An Example for how Most-To-Least vs Least-to-Most mode works:
 *
 * If you have an ArrayBuffer with the following two Uint8s:
 * 185 (0b10111001) and 66 (0b01000010)
 * and you perform a series of readBits: 2 bits, then 3, then 5, then 6.
 *
 * A BitStream in "mtl" mode will yield the following:
 * - readBits(2) => 2 ('10')
 * - readBits(3) => 7 ('111')
 * - readBits(5) => 5 ('00101')
 * - readBits(6) => 2 ('000010')
 *
 * A BitStream in "ltm" mode will yield the following:
 * - readBits(2) => 1 ('01')
 * - readBits(3) => 6 ('110')
 * - readBits(5) => 21 ('10101')
 * - readBits(6) => 16 ('010000')
